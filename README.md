# Llengua Catalana

## Introduction

This code repository compiles the work of the authors over a three week span regarding te data visualisation of the Catalan language usage data and more retrieved from Idescat. The work is naturally divided over the four authors.

#### Authors

David Palau, Eudald Vilar, Guifré Ramos, Lucas Esquenet

## Repositry Structure 

Within this repository there are three directories namely, Figures, Data and Scripts. Inside the repositories the different contibutions of the different authors are ordered by name of the author, namely Guifre, David, Eudald, Lucas. Inside the directory Figures one can find the different plots, such as hitmaps and geographical maps, that were made for this project. Inside the directory Data one can fins the different .csv files, .json and .geojson files. And finally in the directory Scripts one can find the different python codes that read the different files and make the plots.

## Author Contributions

### Guifre
I tried to compare the use of catalan or spanish in different social spheres. To do so, first i studied the evolution from 2003 to 2018
of % of mostly catalan speakers vs the % of mostly spanish speakers. Secondly, I  compared the tendency also from 2003 to 2018 of speaking one
single language or using two languages. These evolutions are classified by social spheres (e.g. social context) like friendships, family, etc.
Finally, I provided a geographic comparison for a fixed year (2018) of the % of exclusive catalan speakers by social spheres.

### David
I stablished a relation between the percentage of the population who speaks catalan with the percentage of foreign population in Catalunya. As data is not very extensive, I only analyzed data from 2001 and 2011, which is related to a high growth of foreign population in Catalonia. I also compared the geographical distributions of both magnitudes thoroughout both years and analyzed the correlation between them.

### Eudald
I took the data from 1986 to 2018 of the use and knowledge of the catalan language and make different maps to visualize the data. The different maps are about how many people are able to speak, read, write and understand the catalan language. I made my maps by Vegueries, a terrotory delineation in between Comarques and Províncies. I chose this distribution because I had more data than if I did it by Comarques and it was more precise than if I did it by Províncies.

### Lucas

I tried to use the socio-economic indicators and then combine the information with the data regarding the language usage surveys. I also looked at population data as a backup. The socio-economic data eventually didn’t seem to fit with the language usage data and so I had to abandon this idea although I found some similar data regarding academic achievements within the population per comarca so I tried to apply this too and got some satisfactory results.
